<h2>What makes this watch unique?</h2>
<p>This design has an unique style. Why? Because this watch can do anything a phone can do, this is the most simplest a phone can get. Just like a phone this watch operate with an sim card; for audio/video calls, unlimited data, apps downloads. With the projector screen you can use it to play games, watch videos, photograph, on 3D. The 3D projector screen gives an more realistic effect on whatever your doing. Why is this product more efficient than a regular phone? This is not just a watch it's a phone into a watch, but better you can save more money, than you spend on broken screeens from carrying it around all day and dropping it. It is waterproof, rather than how some phones and water-resistant. The Illusion 101 also has a night vision sensor. It is also good during physical activities, it keep track of your health and measure your health </p>
