<p>Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychology is a multifaceted discipline and includes many sub-fields of study such areas as human development, sports, health, clinical, social behavior and cognitive processes. Psychology is really a very new science, with most advances happening over the past 150 years or so.  However, its origins can be traced back to ancient Greece, 400 – 500 years BC. In the early days of psychology there were two dominant theoretical perspectives regarding how the brain worked, structuralism and functionalism.</p>
<h1 style="color: #DC1115">The Perspective of Pyschology </h1>
<p><br>
Structuralism and functionalism have since been replaced by several dominant and influential approaches to psychology, each one underpinned by a shared set of assumptions of what people are like, what is important to study and how to study it. Later, the humanistic approach became the 'third force' in psychology and proposed the importance of subjective experience and personal growth.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s psychology began a cognitive revolution, adopting a rigorous, scientific, lab based scientific approach with application to memory, perception, cognitive development, mental illness, and much more.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Psychology</h2>
<p> Why psychology is important? Psychology allows people to understand more about how the body and mind work together. This knowledge can help with decision-making and avoiding stressful situations. It can help with time management, setting and achieving goals, and living effectively.</p>
  <h3>What Is Psychology?</h3>
  <h3><img src="file:///C|/Users/hugtor8295/Desktop/Choices/images/ps psych01.jpg" width="734" height="554" alt=""/></h3>
    <p>Psychology is the study of people's behavior, performance, and mental operations. It also refers to the application of the knowledge, which can be used to understand events, treat mental health issues, and improve education, employment, and relationships. The subject lies at the intersection of applied, educational, and theoretical science.</p>
    <p>There are sub-areas of psychology, including:</p>

      <li>Education</li>
      <li>Business</li>
      <li>Media</li>
      <li>Physical conditions</li>
      <li>Human development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The subject involves other areas of study, including humanities, natural sciences, and the social sciences.</p>
<p>What does Psychology mean? Where does it come from? Hank gives you a 10 minute intro to one of the more tricky sciences and talks about some of the big names in the development of the field.

<p>It's all in the mind.</p>
        — George Harrison   
 
<p>In its primary form, psychology studies people—who and what they are. It looks into why they act and think the way they do and how someone can improve himself or herself. Therefore, everything a person does is connected to the subject.</p>
    <p>Psychology allows people to understand more about how the body and mind work together. This knowledge can help with decision-making and avoiding stressful situations. It can help with time management, setting and achieving goals, and living effectively.</p>
    <p>The science not only allows people to be more successful, but it can also impact their health. It helps many tackle their mental illnesses so that they can continue living their lives. Psychological studies have also aided in drug development and the ability to diagnose various diseases (such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's).</p>
<p>I can personally testify to the importance of the subject. Psychology has helped me as a writer because I have become more determined to do the things I will enjoy and write on the topics that I like. I can understand who I am and look at events on a more positive aspect. Whenever I have a problem, I can handle it better. Down to the choices over the projects I will work on and the way I will handle my time, psychology helps me make better decisions within my life.</p>
